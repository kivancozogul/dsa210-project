# Effect of 3 point shot attempts on total game score

## Project Overview

In this project, effect of the amount of three point shots taken during the game by evaluating average three point shots taken and average game scores throughout years also this project aims to see if positional 3 point shot attempts have an effect on total game.

### Motivation

This project's motivation is to conduct a research about NBA's 3 point revolution.There is a fact that games' scores are much higher than prior years and Center players are taking more 3 point shots comparing to 2010's.I would like to see that if this situation affects the games' total score.



### Datasets

The datas will be collected from NBA API Library.

In the project the collected datas will be:

- **Years in which the stats are trackable**
- **Average three pointer attempts per year for each team**
- **Average three pointer made per year for each team**
- **Average points per game for each team**
- **Average three pointer attempts by positions**

### Research Questions:
**Does the evolution of positional play (specifically the increase in 3-point attempts by all positions) correlate with higher total game scores over the NBA's history (2010-2025)?**

**Do 3 point shot attempts have correlation with higher game scores between 2010-2025?**


## Hypothesis Testing

**Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):**
There is no statistically significant relationship between the increase in 3-point shot attempts by various positions and the total game scores recorded between 1980 and 2025.

**Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$):**
There is a significant positive correlation between the volume of 3-point shots taken by non-guard positions and the total game scores, suggesting that the "positional revolution" has fundamentally inflated game outcomes over the decades.
